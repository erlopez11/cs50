My solutions for the labs and problem sets offered in Harvard cs50.

Labs:

SCRABBLE:
The labs folder contains a scrabble project I created based on a lab prompt provided in the CS50 course. The purpose of this project was to create a scrabble like game where two players may enter a given word and recive a certain number of points based on the letter present in their chosen word. This game focused on the applicatoin of loops, arrays, functions, and conditionals to create a working scrabble game. After getting the code to work, I decided to take the project further by creating a visibally pleasing website design for it. I used html and css to construct the web design. Afterwards I applied what I had learned about DOM to make the website elements like the buttons, input area, rounds, and points interactive and responsive to the code present within the JS file. Creating this project was a great learning expreince in finally being able to connect all three parts of creating a website. This was my first attempt at making a website that also responds to the javascript code that I wrote for it and that is ultimately functional and visibally appealing. After creating this project,I feel I am ready to revisit the rock paper scissors project and make the game into an actual website.
